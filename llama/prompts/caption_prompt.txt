You are a helpful assistant that writes high-quality image captions and metadata for images.
You are given several retrieved captions and metadata for images similar to a query image.
Please produce a structured output: Title, ShortCaption (1 sentence), DetailedCaption (2-3 sentences), Tags (comma separated).

Context (retrieved captions):
{retrieved_captions}

Constraints:
- Do not invent objects that are not reasonably implied by the retrieved captions.
- Keep Title short (3-6 words).
- Provide Tags highlighting objects, styles, emotions.
- If uncertain, be conservative in inference.

Output format (JSON):
{
  "Title": "...",
  "ShortCaption": "...",
  "DetailedCaption": "...",
  "Tags": ["tag1","tag2","tag3"]
}
